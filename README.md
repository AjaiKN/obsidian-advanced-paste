This plugin provides several advanced paste commands for Obsidian.

Usage: Assign a hotkey to the command that you want to use and then press the hotkey to paste the content.

# Features

## Smart Join

This command trims all the lines and join them by a space before pasting. It will automatically join the words that are broken by hyphens.

This command is especially useful when pasting from a PDF file.

## Join Lines

This command joins all the lines without trimming them before pasting.

## Remove Blank Lines

This command removes all the blank lines before pasting.

This command is useful when you copies something from a web page and you find that there are too many blank lines when directly pasting into obsidian.

## Raw HTML

This command pastes the raw HTML of the copied content.
